# hardhat-nft
Created 3 different types of NFT contracts using solidity, ethers.js, hardhat, etc.

In this project, I created three different types of NFTs :-
1. Basic NFT which is the simplest form of NFT,
2. Random IPFS NFT which contains URI hosted on Pinata and lastly
3. Dynamic SVG NFT which is a dynamic NFT whose URI is hosted on IPFS and its in SVG form
